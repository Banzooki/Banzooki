Hi, I'm Thomas. I graduated from the University of Derby with a degree in computer games programming. My ambition is to work on a MMOPRG within a AAA development team. I have skills in c# and c++ and working knowledge of both Unity and the Unreal Engine. I am a team member of a independent company called FireSlug Studios, where I was actively working on developing the enemy AI and some of the UI elements. I'm currently working on an unanounced game with FireSlug, I'm looking to develop my skills with the help of an established team.
